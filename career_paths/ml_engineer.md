### Technology Stack
Just some of the skills ML Engineering professionals use.
One may not need to know all of them, but one technology from each area would make you well-rounded.

#### Software Engineering / Application Development
* Python
* Java
* Scala

### REST API
* Flask

#### Databases / Data Stores
* SQL / Relational
* NoSQL
* Graph (not critically important)

#### Analysis / Query
* SQL

#### Parallel Processing / Distributed Computing
* Spark
* Pandas / Dask

#### Libraries
* Pandas
* numpy
* scikit-learn

#### Cloud
* AWS: S3, Lambda, DynamoDB, Kinesis, Batch ...
* Serverless frameworks, eg. AWS CDK, serverless, chalice

#### Workflow Management / Job Orchestration
* Airflow
* Luigi
* Kubeflow

#### ML Frameworks
* PyTorch
* TensorFlow
* Keras
* FastAPI
* MLFlow
* Sagemaker

#### Deployment
* Docker
